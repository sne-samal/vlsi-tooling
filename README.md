### Lab 0 - VLSI Environment Setup

##### *Peter Cheung, v1.0 - 4 September 2026*
---

**Synopsys** is one of the main suppliers of the software used to design integrated circuits. Their tools take a design written in Verilog and turn it into the masks a foundry can manufacture. Across these labs you will use **_Fusion Compiler_**, **_VCS_**, **_Custom Compiler_**, **_TestMAX_** and **_Formality_**. You will also use tools from Siemens, mainly **_Calibre_**.

A tool on its own knows nothing about the silicon your design will be built in. That comes from a **process design kit (PDK)**, supplied by the foundry that manufactures the chip. It describes one manufacturing process: the transistors, the metal layers, the design rules, and a library of logic gates already built and characterised for it. We use TSMC's 65nm low power process.

This lab puts the tools and a PDK on your `PATH`. The following labs depend on this setup.

**_Where to put this repository on the server_**

The lab instructions assume you clone it into a suitable folder in your home directory - e.g. `~/Labs`, alongside the lab directories:

```
~/Labs/
├── vlsi-tooling/     <- this repository
├── Lab_1/
├── Lab_2/
...
```


---
### Task 1 - Get the files onto the server
---

Clone the repository into `~/Labs`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Labs
cd ~/Labs
git clone git@github.com:sne-samal/vlsi-tooling.git
```

> If you copied the files across with `scp` rather than cloning them, the executable bit is not always preserved. Restore it with `chmod +x ~/Labs/vlsi-tooling/syn`.

---
### Task 2 - Load the tools and a PDK
---

**_Step 1: See which PDKs are available_**

```bash
cd ~/Labs
vlsi-tooling/syn
```

This lists every kit the repository knows about with a one line description. It also confirms the wrapper runs at all.

**_Step 2: Load the TSMC 65nm low power kit_**

```bash
vlsi-tooling/syn tsmc65LP
```

> `syn` replaces your shell with a **fresh tcsh** carrying the environment. This is deliberate: it means the setup can never half-apply itself to the shell you were working in. It also loads **one PDK per shell**, so to switch PDK you type `exit` first.

You must run `syn` once in every terminal window, before the first Synopsys tool in that window. Nothing is written to your `~/.cshrc`.

**_Step 3: Read what it prints_**

The load prints three blocks. Read them rather than scrolling past.

| Block | What to look for |
|---|---|
| `--- tools ---` | The resolved path of each tool. `NOT ON PATH` against a tool means the install was not found, and that tool will not run. |
| `--- kit: tsmc65LP ---` | The technology file, reference libraries and Tcl setup for the PDK. The `ref libs` line is where the shared libraries were found. |
| `--- licences ---` | The licence servers being used. |

**_Step 4: Check the environment by hand_** (optional)

```bash
which fc_shell
echo $SYN_TOOLS_DIR
ls -l $SYN_TECH_FILE
```

`$SYN_TOOLS_DIR` is the path to this repository. Use it whenever a lab asks you to run a script from here, and the command will work from any directory.

---
### Task 3 - Check the reference libraries
---

Fusion Compiler does not read the foundry's Liberty and LEF files directly. It reads its own format, an **NDM** library, and the TSMC kit does not ship one. These have been built for you and put in a shared read-only location, so there is nothing here for you to build. The `ref libs` line printed in Task 2 is where they were found.

There are **two** of them, not one. The fillers and tap cells have no timing arcs, so they are absent from the timed library and are held separately.

Check that both are readable and complete before going any further:

```bash
fc_shell -f $SYN_TOOLS_DIR/check_ndm.tcl
```

Expect:

```
 special cells       : all 28 present

PASS
```

This checks the contents rather than the exit status, because a library can exist and still be empty or missing cells. The 28 are the cells the place and route scripts ask for **by name**: the tap cell, the tie cells, the fillers, and the clock tree buffers and inverters. A missing one otherwise surfaces much later as a confusing placement or clock tree error.

If you see `FAIL`, or the check reports a library that does not exist, stop and ask for help.

---
### Task 4 - Unload
---

```bash
exit
```

This drops you back into the shell you started from and removes the environment with it. Since only one PDK can be loaded per shell, this is also how you switch PDK.

---
### Files in this repository
---

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `syn` | Lists the available PDKs, or loads one into a fresh shell. |
| `custom` | Prepares the current directory, then launches Custom Compiler in it. |
| `memcomp` | Launches TSMC's MC2 memory compiler in the current directory. |
| `stil2verilog` | Wrapper round the TestMAX pattern translator, which needs a system library that is not on the default path. |
| `setup.cshrc` | Entry point: sources the tool file, then the kit file, then reports what resolved. |
| `synopsys_tools.cshrc` | Tool paths, version discovery and licence servers, independent of any PDK. |
| `kits/<kit>.cshrc` | Every filesystem path belonging to one PDK, exported into the environment. |
| `kits/<kit>.tcl` | The same paths under shorter names for Tcl scripts, plus cell names, corners and layers. |
| `kits/<kit>.libdefs` | The OpenAccess library list, copied into your working directory as `lib.defs`. |
| `build_ndm.tcl` | Builds the shared NDM reference libraries from the foundry's LEF and Liberty files. Run once by a maintainer, not per student. |
| `check_ndm.tcl` | Reports whether those libraries are readable and hold the cells the labs need. |

Load order is `syn` -> `setup.cshrc` -> `synopsys_tools.cshrc` -> `kits/<kit>.cshrc`.

No script in any lab contains a PDK path. They start with `source $env(SYN_KIT_TCL)` and use the names defined there, so changing PDK means loading a different kit and nothing else.

Running this anywhere other than the EEE teaching servers needs a handful of paths changed. See [docs/site_setup.md](docs/site_setup.md).
